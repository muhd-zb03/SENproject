<p> For almost a century, Italian fashion labels have been prominent among the finest luxury brands worldwide. Brands such as Versace, Prada, Armani, Gucci, and Dolce & Gabbana  have had a lasting impact on the fashion world, and continue to do so. Perhaps the most acclaimed of these Italian fashion brands is Gucci. Guccio Gucci, the son of a humble leathergoods business owner, opened the very first Gucci store in Florence, Italy in 1921. His inspiration for the small luggage brand was sparked by London, and the aesthetic of English nobility. Guccio’s brand soon became acclaimed in Italy for its quality leathergoods and fine attention to detail. In 1953, the same year that Guccio Gucci passed away, Gucci’s first overseas store became a reality in New York City.

In just a little under a century, Gucci has thrived worldwide. Located in affluent locations such as Chicago, San Francisco, and Beverly Hills, there are over 30 Gucci flagship stores in the United States, and approximately 500 flagship stores worldwide. In the very beginning, Gucci was entirely centered around leather goods. The fashion label’s emergence in the clothing facet of the brand came from the creation of the iconic Gucci loafer that had a metal horsebit. To this date, the shoe still possesses an incredible amount of detailing and elegance, as it remains the only shoe in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. All of the original pairs adopted a North American moccasin style, and embodied a graceful touch as every pair was handcrafted to be as soft and lightweight as possible. This great representation of the brand’s integrity hasn’t withered over the years; every single pair of the classic loafers are still handmade to this date. While attaining much recognition for the brand’s production of stunning leather goods, as well as the elegant assembly of the Gucci loafers, the brand started to experiment with other garments and clothing pieces upon request. In synonymous timing, the brand started to become more and more famed in the United States. Perhaps the most prominent American to flaunt the brand at the time was John F. Kennedy’s wife, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. In the early 1960’s, the bag that first lady had been seen with almost daily, was renamed the “Jackie.” The First Lady was accompanied by another world-renowned woman, Princess of Monaco Grace Kelly, who made a personal request for a handcrafted scarf from the brand. As this scarf became increasingly sought after, the brand dubbed it the Fora Print Scarf.
